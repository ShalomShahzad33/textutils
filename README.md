# CS50 Final Project - Text Utils

This is a TextUtils App. In this app you input some text and this app will tell you amount of words in it, amount of characters, and will show you the preview. You can use "Convert to Uppercase", "Convert to Lowercase", and "Clear Text" buttons to convert the text into Uppercase, Lowercase, or clear the text respectively. Developed by Shalom Shahzad

Technologies used:

- React
